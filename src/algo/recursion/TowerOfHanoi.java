/**
 * Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. 
 * The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
 * 1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * 2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
 * 3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Take an example for 2 disks :
 * Let rod 1 = 'A', rod 2 = 'B', rod 3 = 'C'.

 * The pattern here is :
 * Shift 'n-1' disks from 'A' to 'B'.
 * Shift last disk from 'A' to 'C'.
 * Shift 'n-1' disks from 'B' to 'C'.
 *
 * For n disks, total 2^n â€“ 1 moves are required.
