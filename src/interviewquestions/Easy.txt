Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.


37)**Guess Number Higher or Lower**
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
Note:
You may assume that the array does not change.
There are many calls to sumRange function.

40)**House Robber**
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

42)**Implement Queue using Stacks**
Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
peek() -- Get the front element.
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]

57)**Reverse Bits**
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).
Follow up:
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?


58)**Assign Cookies**
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.


59) **Swap Nodes in Pairs**
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
For example,
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may not modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.
Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

61)**Repeated Substring Pattern**
Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.

Input: "abab"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.

62)**Add Strings**
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.
Note:

Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

[1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
[1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
[1,3,5,6], 0 → 0

65)**Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree**
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

66)**Number of Segments in a String**
Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.
Please note that the string does not contain any non-printable characters.

Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
Example: 19 is a happy number
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

72)Length of Last Word
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

For example,
Given s = "Hello World",
return 5.

73)Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
Note: There are at least two nodes in this BST.
